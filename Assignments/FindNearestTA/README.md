### Problem history:
We have a number of exercise solutions with a two-dimensional address and name. We are going to write a program that announces the exercise solution closer to us.
### How the program works:
Using an extracted data with X and Y fields and the name of the exercise solution in another function, calculates and stores the Euclidean distance, and in another function compares distances and names.
