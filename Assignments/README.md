#### 
The n queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an n x n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century. In the modern era, it is often used as an example problem for various computer programming techniques.

n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard. Solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n = 2 and n = 3. Although the exact number of solutions is only known for n ≤ 27, the asymptotic growth rate of the number of solutions is (0.143 n)n.

#### 
This project was the first complete software that I did in the first semester of my university in the course of computer basics and programming with C ++ language.
As far as possible, none of the mathematical computational functions are used in this program
```This app run in consol```
####
And this program has nested menus that are made with nested loops
I included the original:
- 1- **Numerical calculations**:
  - 1- Sum +
  - 2- Mines -
  - 3- multi x
  - 4- divide /
  - 5- sqrt 
  - 6- power ^
  - 7- facroeial !
  - 8- Show the divisor of the number
  - 9- Check the completeness of the number
  - 10- check Prime numbers
  - 11- return to main menu
-  2- **Matrix operations :**
   - 1-  Sum matrix
   - 2- mines matrix
   - 3- multi mareix
   - 4- matrix transpose
   - 5- determinan
   - 6- multi a number in matrixs
   - 7- return to main menu
 - 3- **Trigonometric operations :**
    - 1- sin
    - 2- cos
    - 3- tan
    - 4- cot
    - 5- return to main menu

- 1- **Date Basic :** creat object from Date class & set and print time with rule and law.
- 2- **Date Constr:** call class constructor function.
- 3- **Date Accessors :** define the getter function for accessing private class values.
- 4- **Date Helper :** add a function for detect a leap year.

- 6- **Date Inc One Day :** add function for increase one day of date.
- 7- **Date Diff :** add a function to calculate the difference between two dates.
- 8- **Str To Date :** add a function for when the constructor function is called by a **"String"** and wants to create an object of the date class
- 9- **Date Vector :** add a function for when the constructor function is called by a **"Vector"** and wants to create an object of the date class
- 10- **Composition :** combining a Person class and Date class to make an object of a person with a valid date of birth

#### Creating a class for calculating four main operations(× + - /) with defining and coding operators such as adding an integer with the rational number "+" and adding two rational numbers together "+" and "= +" and ...
## Floyd Warshall algorithm :

#### In computer science, the Floyd–Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a directed weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights.A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths of shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. Although it does not return details of the paths themselves, it is possible to reconstruct the paths with simple modifications to the algorithm. Versions of the algorithm can also be used for finding the transitive closure of a relation  or  widest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

#### Enter the exact time, then you can find out what time of day (morning after noon) or night (evening and night)! :))
## Template Class :

#### A template is a simple and yet very powerful tool in C++. The simple idea is to pass data type as a parameter so that we don’t need to write the same code for different data types. For example, a software company may need sort() for different data types. Rather than writing and maintaining the multiple codes, we can write one sort() and pass data type as a parameter.
