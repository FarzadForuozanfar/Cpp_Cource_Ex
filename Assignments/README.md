- 1- **Date Basic :** creat object from Date class & set and print time with rule and law.
- 2- **Date Constr:** call class constructor function.
- 3- **Date Accessors :** define the getter function for accessing private class values.

#### Creating a class for calculating four main operations(× + - /) with defining and coding operators such as adding an integer with the rational number "+" and adding two rational numbers together "+" and "= +" and ...
## Floyd Warshall algorithm :

#### In computer science, the Floyd–Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a directed weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights.A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths of shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. Although it does not return details of the paths themselves, it is possible to reconstruct the paths with simple modifications to the algorithm. Versions of the algorithm can also be used for finding the transitive closure of a relation  or  widest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

#### Enter the exact time, then you can find out what time of day (morning after noon) or night (evening and night)! :))
## Template Class :

#### A template is a simple and yet very powerful tool in C++. The simple idea is to pass data type as a parameter so that we don’t need to write the same code for different data types. For example, a software company may need sort() for different data types. Rather than writing and maintaining the multiple codes, we can write one sort() and pass data type as a parameter.
