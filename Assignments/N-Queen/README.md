The n queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an n x n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century. In the modern era, it is often used as an example problem for various computer programming techniques.

n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard. Solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n = 2 and n = 3. Although the exact number of solutions is only known for n ≤ 27, the asymptotic growth rate of the number of solutions is (0.143 n)n.
