#### 
This project was the first complete software that I did in the first semester of my university in the course of computer basics and programming with C ++ language.
As far as possible, none of the mathematical computational functions are used in this program
```This app run in consol```
####
And this program has nested menus that are made with nested loops
I included the original:
- 1- **Numerical calculations**:
  - 1- Sum +
  - 2- Mines -
  - 3- multi x
  - 4- divide /
  - 5- sqrt 
  - 6- power ^
  - 7- facroeial !
  - 8- Show the divisor of the number
  - 9- Check the completeness of the number
  - 10- check Prime numbers
  - 11- return to main menu
-  2- **Matrix operations :**
   - 1-  Sum matrix
   - 2- mines matrix
   - 3- multi mareix
   - 4- matrix transpose
   - 5- determinan
   - 6- multi a number in matrixs
   - 7- return to main menu
 - 3- **Trigonometric operations :**
    - 1- sin
    - 2- cos
    - 3- tan
    - 4- cot
    - 5- return to main menu
 - 4- **about us**
 - 5- **Exit program**
